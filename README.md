# JOGASIMA
ML Competition Project Repository with JOrdan, GAston, SIlvia and MAria

This repository is for the private use of the ML group

When commiting changes please be as specific as to: what code was changed (sections, lines),
the purpose of the changes (i.e. add this functionality, fix this error) and
if necessary any forking / versioning information that may be useful for debugging
reverting later on

We should establish software development milestones (i.e. data cleaned and ready, features created etc.)
that when accomplished (and tested) are committed to the Master branch, but while still
being coded and tested they should be "branched" so that any errors are ring-fenced, and any 
backwards-applied fixes to the master can be merged with the new branch when it is appropriate
